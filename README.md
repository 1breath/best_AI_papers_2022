# 2022: A Year Full of Amazing AI papers- A Review [WORK IN PROGRESS] üìå
## A curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI by release date with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and¬†code.

While the world is still recovering, research hasn't slowed its frenetic pace, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. More, many important aspects were highlighted this year, like the ethical aspects, important biases, governance, transparency and much more. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its link to AI are constantly evolving, showing promising applications improving our life's quality in the near future. Still, we ought to be careful with which technology we choose to apply.

Here is a work in progress of the most interesting research papers for 2022. In short, it is curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI and Data Science by release date with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and code (if applicable). Enjoy the read!

üëÄ **If you'd like to support my work** and use W&B (for free) to track your ML experiments and make your work reproducible or collaborate with a team, you can try it out by following [this guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb)! Since most of the code here is PyTorch-based, we thought that a [QuickStart guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb) for using W&B on PyTorch would be most interesting to share.

üëâFollow [this quick guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb), use the same W&B lines in your code or any of the repos below, and have all your experiments automatically tracked in your w&b account! It doesn't take more than 5 minutes to set up and will change your life as it did for me! [Here's a more advanced guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Organizing_Hyperparameter_Sweeps_in_PyTorch_with_W%26B.ipynb) for using Hyperparameter Sweeps if interested :)

## Resolution-robust Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions [1]<a name="1"></a>
You‚Äôve most certainly experienced this situation once: You take a great picture with your friend, and someone is photobombing behind you, ruining your future Instagram post. Well, that‚Äôs no longer an issue. Either it is a person or a trashcan you forgot to remove before taking your selfie that‚Äôs ruining your picture. This AI will just automatically remove the undesired object or person in the image and save your post. It‚Äôs just like a professional photoshop designer in your pocket, and with a simple click!

This task of removing part of an image and replacing it with what should appear behind has been tackled by many AI researchers for a long time. It is called image inpainting, and it‚Äôs extremely challenging...

## Stitch it in Time: GAN-Based Facial Editing of Real Videos [2]<a name="2"></a>
You've most certainly seen movies like the recent Captain Marvel or Gemini Man where Samuel L Jackson and Will Smith appeared to look like they were much younger. This requires hundreds if not thousands of hours of work from professionals manually editing the scenes he appeared in.
Instead, you could use a simple AI and do it within a few minutes. Indeed, many techniques allow you to add smiles, make you look younger or older, all automatically using AI-based algorithms. It is called AI-based face manipulations in videos and here's the current state-of-the-art in 2022!
